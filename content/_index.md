*Who are we?*

Arobana is a resturant whose cuisine is inspired by Traditional Eastern African recipes, specifically from Eritrea and Ethiopia. We have a wide-variety of dishes from spicy meat stews to tapas-like range of vegetratian sauces. A staple part of our meal is injera, a sour-like pancake which is used using your hands to wrap sauces.
